"""
looping through ranges
set number of times you want to loop through the data set but limit it
the code on top
range takes 2 -3 arguments add the colon at the end
it iterates over the range and prints 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 
a range works like grabbing and slicing items in a list (doesn't go to ten stops up to 10)
########################################
the code on bottom
what if you wanna skip values
1, 10, 2 still goes over the range but
instead incrementing by 1 it goes and skips everyother one
