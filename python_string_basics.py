sentence = 'The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog' # 

sentence_two = 'That is my dog\'s bowl' #  <---start with single quotes then use a backslash(which the backlash treats the next character as a string)

sentence_three = "That is my dog's bowl"  # <--- double quotes started the string and then the apostrophe works

sentence_four = "Tiffany said, \"That is my dog's bowl\"" # <--- insert a backslash in the beginning and then on the end so the double quotes can be placed in the sentence
